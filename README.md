Here's a summary of my Social Media Simulation App:

Redux Setup:
I've efficiently implemented Redux Toolkit to manage the state of your application. The Redux store and slices are well-organized to handle authentication, user data, and other app state.

Navigation:
My app features both tab navigation and drawer navigation, providing users with multiple options for navigating between different sections of the app. The tab navigation allows easy access to the Home, Add Post, and Profile screens, while the drawer navigation provides additional navigation options.

Authentication:
Authentication flows are included for user registration, login, and secure access to certain app features. Users can log in securely using their username and password, with authentication handled through AsyncStorage and Redux.

Features:

Users can view a feed of posts on the Home screen, with each post displaying the date, username, image, description, likes, and comments.
They can add new posts with a caption and photo, either from the device's gallery or by taking a photo with the camera.
Users can like and comment on posts, with real-time updates to the post's likes and comments.
The Profile screen displays user information, including username, user ID, name, email, gender, and profile picture. Users can also log out from this screen.
Performance Optimization:
Efficient list rendering techniques have been implemented to enhance the app's responsiveness, with the use of FlatList and optimized rendering logic.
useMemo and useCallback hooks are utilized to prevent unnecessary renders and improve overall performance.

Deep Linking and Notifications:
Deep linking functionality is integrated within the app, allowing users to navigate directly to specific content or features. Local and push notifications are set up to enhance user engagement within the app, with notifications displayed when a new post is added.

Platform-specific Customization:
The app's design and functionality are customized based on the platform using the Platform API and third-party libraries, ensuring a seamless experience on both iOS and Android platforms.

Overall, My Social Media Simulation App provides users with a smooth and feature-rich experience, with efficient state management, navigation, authentication, and performance optimization.
